Procedure demo_qty_and_price() is called with a parameter which is a file name, which inherently calls main() in the same .py.
   The file parameter may have a file name that starts with JOB-....xml
        This filename is constructed in GaskUI-->Summarize Orders(ButtonClick action (lambda fucntion))--> 
               Get_JobEntry()-->read_tmp_file()
                          where is reading a tmp_file.txt to read  contents within this file to get the 
                       JOB<xxx>.xml name.  (Statement file.readlines())
       tmp_file is getting populated  Copy_Jobname()
                            if f_job[:3] == "JOB":
                               with open(tmpf,"w") as file:    #Open file in write mode.
      Copy_Jobname()  itself is getting called from open_file(), which is triggered when we click on the filr name in the UI treeview of file listing.  
      So once tmp_file gets written into with JOB<xxxx> , module readQuotefile.py is gettign called.         

readQuotefile--> main() --> readjobfile.read_jobs()
          read_jobs is using the xml.tree libarry like this
                 Et.parse(jobfile)
          and then doing this simple extraction using the elemnts tags in the JOB-XXX.xml 
                        for l1 in topattr.findall('l1'):
        			text = l1.text
       				 timestamp, uuid, filetag = text.split(',')
      				  print(f"Timestamp {timestamp}  uuid {uuid}   filetag {filetag}")
      			     if filetag == "Quote":
      					      qlist = uuid + ',' + qlist
      			     if filetag == "RequestForQuote":
        			    reqlist = uuid + ',' + reqlist

      This section of findall looping is what we have to replace with 're' library.
